                <p>What Iâ€™ve learned from PD so far is how to improve my communication skills, networking, and overall
                    become a better me.</p>

                <p>I have improved on consistency and being balanced. These are the the two core values I felt were
                    important for me to learn and eventually master because you can become very effective and efficient
                    when being consistent with completing goals and have the ability to be balanced and have the
                    awareness to beat the struggles it takes to achieve the goals.</p>

                <p>Express myself thoroughly and respectfully. I also possess a newfound drive and determination to
                    continue developing my brand, with the intention of offering support and motivation to anyone in
                    need. I am excited about the opportunity to inspire others and create a positive impact.</p>

                <p>Branding myself. <br />For this, I had to do self-reflection in multiple directions, and I was able to
                    explain myself better than before.</p>
                <p>Confidence! <br />
                    I used to shrink myself while having a career break and keep failing to get a job. But through PD
                    class, I was able to gain more confidence than before, and this has been a great experience for me.
                </p>
                <p> I feel that I can now explain myself more effectively in the job interview and know better way to

                <h1>Mercedes</h1>
                <p>In Professional Development class, I have learned to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Network</em> with other professionals. This has helped me learn from others and find new
                        opportunities. </li>
                    <li><em>Take risks.</em> This can be scary, but it is also necessary for growth. When we take risks,
                        we are forced to step outside of our comfort zone and learn new things.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>One of the core values that I have improved upon is effective communication, both verbally and in
                    writing, as well as listening to understand others. This will help me work more effectively with my
                    colleagues and supervisors, leading to better collaborations, problem-solving, and decision-making.
                </p>
                <p>I am confident that I can now adapt better to any changes in my career. This will help me achieve
                    career success in a rapidly changing world.
                    I am convinced that these skills will be beneficial to me in both my professional and personal life.
