                    My why is to advance in software development and effective communication to pursue a lifelong career in tech.</p>
                <p><em>Eunjung</em><br />
                    First, I want to be myself. Also, I want to be a professional working mom and gain financial stability.</p>
                <p><em>Garrett</em><br /> 
                    I want to build a project that will better enable my community to build comradery and kinships.</p>
                <p><em>Manish</em><br />
                    To pursue a career in tech and be able to support myself and my family.</p>
                <p><em>Miranda</em><br />
                    My why is to gain new skills and knowledge, especially in technology, to improve myself and my future. </p>

                <p><em>Ernest</em><br />Consistency and balance. I felt these were important for me to learn and eventually master to become more effective and efficient when handling challenges to reach my goals.</p>
                <p><em>Eunjung</em><br />Through PD class, I learned how to brand myself. For this, I had to do self-reflection in multiple directions, and I was able to explain myself better than before. Also, I gained more confidence!
                </p>
                <p><em>Garrett</em><br />
                    I realized that ‚Äòclosed mouths don't get fed‚Äô so no I am able to express my needs without feeling anxious or as if im burdening others
                </p>
                <p><em>Manish</em><br />
                    At Per Scholas I learned that I‚Äôm part of a community with talented and kind individuals. I learned to be persistent and resilient in pursuit of my goals.</p>
                <p><em>Miranda</em><br />Coach P's guidance helped me learn consistency, balance, and risk-taking. I now can pursue my goals more effectively and deal with challenges better. </p>
